# Tier 1: MVP User Experience

As a user, I want to be able to:

* access a deployed version of the website so I can identify my pine tree
* view a list of the different pine trees of MA
* view a single pine tree for more information
* click through a pine tree identification guide to identify my specific tree
* have a special page that appears that says "your tree is..." with a link to that tree's single view page

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to:

* save my identified trees to a page that I can revisit
* add special notes to my page about each tree
* no one else should be able to edit this page except for me.

As an administrator, I want to be able to:

* have validated data to ensure reliability

- i.e. each user that creates an account should only be able to do so once with a single email address.

As an engineer, I want to:

* have a well-seeded database so that I am able to simulate a number of different scenarios
* user data to be secure so that no one can unrightfully manipulate information.

* have full rights to make backend requests to add, edit, and remove users and their information.

- No one else should have access.

* view user information.

- No one else should have access.
